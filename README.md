# Halting Problem


I have been thinking about this problem and relationship with in our lives. We use computational thinking and computation is an instrument of ours. Therefore, evolution and computation should have a intersection. **Game Theory** is a form of mathematics that in intersection of these two. However, I had a thought about halting problem and derivatives. Therefore, I wanted to share these result with you.
